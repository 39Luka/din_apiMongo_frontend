# Product Detail Component

The `ProductDetail` component is responsible for displaying the detailed information of a specific product. It is a key part of the catalog experience, allowing users to see the price, category, and description of the item they are interested in.

## Usage

## Examples

### Default Product (Bread)
This represents the standard view for a product like "Pan Rústico".

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ProductDetailStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### Pastry (Bollería)
Example of how the component renders a pastry item, like a Croissant.
